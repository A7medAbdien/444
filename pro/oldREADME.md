# PROJECT Domain: 

Our lives have moved digitally and we are increasingly relying more and more on digital
equipment to support our current lifestyle. **Cold Stores** are scattered all around Bahrain and
provide the public a convenient location to quickly purchase from a wide array of consumable
products (predominantly food) and services. These convenient stores requires management
by owners. 

For example:
* the cold-store owner would like to receive a weekly supply of food products from different suppliers.
*  The owner may have to place a supply order to the supplier for example at least few days earlier to secure a delivery. 
*  On delivery date, the supplier provides the products to the cold-store owner.
*  The owner has to update the store stock numbers. 
*  The owner would like to also know what was sold over a day/week or over any period.

* The POS (point of sale) device places all transactions in the database, 
* and the owner can view the reports and details about the running of the store.

You are to design and implement a mobile app to facilitate support for cold-store owner management. 
The app should be able to:
- register user information, view items, 
- search and filter items. 
- View activities (list of activities and their data), orders, invoices, and notifications. 
- Save supplier details and place orders. 
- Generate and display reports of various needs. 
- Specify advanced search parameters to generate different statistics about products and save results to use for placing orders from
suppliers.
